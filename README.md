# Chess Piece Detection

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook which demonstrates the use of YOLOv3, a deep learning algorithm for object detection, to identify chess pieces in images.

## Features

- **YOLOv3 Model**: Utilizes the YOLOv3 model, known for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection.
- **PyTorch Framework**: Built using the PyTorch library to facilitate model training and inference.
- **Roboflow Dataset**: Integrates a pre-processed chess piece dataset from Roboflow, optimized for object detection tasks.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you will need:
- Python 3
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- GPU (recommended for training and inference speeds)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages:
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to download the required dataset and set up the YOLOv3 model for training.

## Usage

- Execute the notebook cells sequentially to setup, train, and test the chess piece detection model.
- Visualize the detection results directly within the Jupyter notebook.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you have improvements or want to adapt the model for similar tasks, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
